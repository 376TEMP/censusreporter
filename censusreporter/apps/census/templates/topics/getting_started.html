<h2>What's in the Census?</h2>
<p>The Census isn't one thing. The U.S. Census Bureau has a number of data collection programs and even more data products based on them. Census Reporter focuses on just one of them, the American Community Survey, or ACS. Our <a href="{% url 'topic_detail' 'about-census' %}">About the Census</a> page gets into the basics you should know about the other Census products.</p>
<h2>OK, then, what's in the ACS?</h2>
<p>The ACS covers a good variety of general-interest topics about the US: not only basic demographics like age, sex, and race, but also a number of economic and social questions, and details about the actual homes where people live, like how many rooms are in a housing unit and how many units are in the building. Our <a href="{% url 'topic_detail' 'table-codes' %}">guide to the structure of table codes</a> includes <a href="{% url 'topic_detail' 'table-codes' %}#table-subjects">a list of the main subject areas.</a></p>
